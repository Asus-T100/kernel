/*
 * GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS / REQUIREMENTS
 *
 * 1. HAL entries mentioned in this document are intended to be simple wrappers
 *    on top of register reads and writes. They should not keep any state
 *    and should not implement any policies. It is completely up to higher
 *    levels when and how to use these entries. The only safety checks HAL
 *    entries should do is for NULL pointers and (in very few cases) for
 *    correctness of values supplied for register writes (range and alignment
 *    checks).
 * 2. HAL should be implemented in such a way that they can be used in both
 *    both user and kernel space code.
 * 3. HAL should hide actual register layout where appropriate (infoframes, csc
 *    coefficients, etc). This objective is not met at the moment since in some
 *    cases (DMA configuration) we assume that end user knows the register
 *    layout (at least for now).
