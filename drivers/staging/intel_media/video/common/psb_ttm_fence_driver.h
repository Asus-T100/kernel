/**
 * struct ttm_fence_driver
 *
 * @has_irq: Called by a potential waiter. Should return 1 if a
 * fence object with indicated parameters is expected to signal
 * automatically, and 0 if the fence implementation needs to
 * repeatedly call @poll to make it signal.
 * @emit:    Make sure a fence with the given parameters is
 * present in the indicated command stream. Return its sequence number
 * in "breadcrumb".
 * @poll:    Check and report sequences of the given "fence_class"
 *           that have signaled "types"
 * @flush:   Make sure that the types indicated by the bitfield
 *           ttm_fence_class_manager::pending_flush will eventually
 *           signal. These bits have been put together using the
 *           result from the needed_flush function described below.
 * @needed_flush: Given the fence_class and fence_types indicated by
 *           "fence", and the last received fence sequence of this
 *           fence class, indicate what types need a fence flush to
 *           signal. Return as a bitfield.
 * @wait:    Set to non-NULL if the driver wants to override the fence
 *           wait implementation. Return 0 on success, -EBUSY on failure,
 *           and -ERESTART if interruptible and a signal is pending.
 * @signaled:  Driver callback that is called whenever a
 *           ttm_fence_object::signaled_types has changed status.
 *           This function is called from atomic context,
 *           with the ttm_fence_class_manager::lock held in write mode.
 * @lockup:  Driver callback that is called whenever a wait has exceeded
 *           the lifetime of a fence object.
 *           If there is a GPU lockup,
 *           this function should, if possible, reset the GPU,
 *           call the ttm_fence_handler with an error status, and
 *           return. If no lockup was detected, simply extend the
 *           fence timeout_jiffies and return. The driver might
 *           want to protect the lockup check with a mutex and cache a
 *           non-locked-up status for a while to avoid an excessive
 *           amount of lockup checks from every waiting thread.
