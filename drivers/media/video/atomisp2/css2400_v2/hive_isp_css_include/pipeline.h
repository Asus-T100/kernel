/*
 * This file is included on every cell {SP,ISP,host} and on every system
 * that uses the pipeline.
 *
 * Problematic is the definition of the pipeline. For the moment it refers
 * to the algorithmic pipeline (i.e. a DAG of kernels) as the user would see
 * it. The pipeline thus aggregates all parameter sets of all kernels
 * irrespective of the partitioning of the pipeline over stages or sections
 *
 * System and cell specific interfaces and inline code are included
 * conditionally through Makefile path settings.
 *
 *  - .        system and cell agnostic interfaces, constants and identifiers
 *	- public:  system agnostic, cell specific interfaces
 *	- private: system dependent, cell specific interfaces & inline implementations
 *	- global:  system specific constants and identifiers
 *	- local:   system and cell specific constants and identifiers
