/*! \mainpage Introduction
This document describes the API that controls the software that is part of the
 HiveGo CSS 3016 series Camera System Solution. We will refer to this API as
 the CSS API.
Silicon Hive also provides a 3A library which comes with its own APIs; these
 will be described in a separate document.
This camera subsystem consists of 2 parts, the hardware subsystem and the
 software stack that implements the ISP functionality on top of this hardware.
 In this chapter we introduce both briefly. For more detailed information about
 the hardware or ISP features we refer to the ISP Datasheet.

\section css_hw_sec CSS Hardware
The following is a block diagram of the CSS hardware.
\image latex doc_hiveblockdia.png "HiveGo CSS 3016 Block Diagram" width=16cm
This diagram shows the following hardware blocks.

\subsection css_hw_isp_sec ISP2300 Vector Processor
This is a fully programmable 10 issue slot VLIW processor. Of these 10 issue
 slots, 9 are vector issue slots which contain 64-way vector (SIMD) operations.
 This processor is where all the ISP processing is implemented. Each ISP mode
 is implemented as one or more executables which run on this processor. This
 processor has local memory which is used as a line buffer. This memory can be
 access by the input formatters, DMA, GDC and Scalar Processor (SP).
\subsection css_hw_sp_sec Scalar Processor
The Scalar Processor (SP) is a control processor with a very small silicon
 footprint. It is used to program the subsystem. Next to full access to the
 local configuration bus this processor also has direct connections to several
 other blocks in the subsystem such as input formatters, DMA and GDC engine.
 Typically, this processor is used as a micro controller to hide hardware
 details from the host CPU code. It can also be used to offload control
 oriented tasks from the ISP.
\subsection css_hw_mipi_sec MIPI CSI2 Receiver
This is a hardwired MIPI CSI2 receiver. It is capable of receiving MIPI CSI2
 data streams via its 1lane or 4lane CSI2 ports. CSI2 decompression has been
 implemented here. The output of this receiver gets sent to one or more input
 formatters.
\subsection css_hw_if_sec Input Formatters
There are 3 input formatters in the subsystem. These input formatters convert a
 stream of incoming pixels into lines of pixel data in the ISP (vector) memory.
 These input formatters can be programmed via their control slave ports. This
 can be done either from the Scalar Processor or from the host CPU.
\subsection css_hw_dma_sec DMA
The DMA in the CSS subsystem is used to transfer large amounts of data such as
 input and output image data or large parameter sets. This DMA can be configured
 by the ISP or SP and has support for sign and zero extension while transferring
 data.
\subsection css_hw_mmu_sec MMU
The CSS subsystem contains an MMU to access external memory. This allows us to
 share page tables with the host CPU OS. The MMU is programmed by the host OS
 after memory has been allocated. It has 2 registers: one to set the L1 page
 table base address and one to invalidate the TLB inside the MMU.
 DEPRECATED: MMU programming is an HRT abckend function outside the scope of CSS
\subsection css_hw_gdc_sec GDC / Scaling Accelerator
Commonly referred to as "GDC block" this hardwired accelerator can perform
 the following functionality:
-# Scaling (upscaling, downscaling, digital zoom).
-# Geometric Distortion and Chromatic Abberation Correction.
This block is configured via its 32 bit slave port as well as the FIFO based
 connection with the ISP and SP.
\section css_sw_sec CSS Software
On top of the fully programmable CSS subsystem, we created an ISP software
 stack.
\subsection css_sw_isp_sec System integration
The CSS software is split into FW running on the ISP sub-system and a stub
on a (remote)host. The CSS API is the interface of the stub to the driver
the CSS DLI connects it to the FW. Since the stub can be integrated on different
systems. the connectivity to the ISP sub-system is not known. The integrator is
responsible for providing the connectivity functions, known as HRT backend
there are four HRT backend functions
-# Device access, the CSS assumes an interface as defined in "device_access.h"
-# Memory access, the CSS assumes an interface as defined in "memory_access.h"
-# Program load and start control. Undefined
-# Threads. Undefined
\subsection css_sw_isp_sec ISP Modes
This software ISP provides the following features:
-# Preview mode: a low-power movie mode used for preview. This produces one
 output stream of up to 720p resolution. This output stream is typically
 displayed on the LCD to represent the viewfinder.
-# Still capture modes: we provide 3 still capture modes. Each mode outputs
 2 data streams, one for the viewfinder (sometimes referred to as post-view)
 and one for the full resolution captures.
  -# Raw/YUV capture. In this mode, we capture the sensor output data directly
  to external memory, without any processing. This can be applied to RAW bayer
  data, YUV data and RGB data. In this mode we do provide some format
  conversions such as YUYV to YUV420 where data is only rearranged, not
  processed.
  -# Primary capture. This is the main still image capture mode. This mode
  contains image enhancement features especially selected for still capture.
  -# Advanced capture. This more advanced still capture mode contains the same
  features as the primary capture mode plus more advanced features such as
  Geometric Distortion and Chromatic Aberration Correction (GDCAC), support
  for Digital Image Stabilization (DIS) and Multi-Axis Color Correction (MACC).
-# Video capture mode: this mode is an enhanced version of the preview mode.
 It produces 2 output streams (viewfinder and full resolution output) and
 supports a capture resolution of up to 1080p. In addition to the features
 contained in the preview mode, it supports Temporal Noise Reduction (TNR)
 , Digital Video Stabilization (DVS) and other video specific ISP optimizations.
All modes support Digital Zoom, implemented on the GDC accelerator block and a
 range of ISP parameters to fine tune functionality such as edge enhancement,
 noise reduction, black level compensation and more.
\subsection css_sw_ctrl_sec Control Flow
Under normal circumstances, the ISP processes streaming input data (coming from
 a MIPI CSI2 compatible image sensor) and writes the output to a frame buffer in
 DDR. The following steps are taken to start this process:
-# The atomisp driver configures the CSS API regarding mode of operation, output
 resolution, data formats and parameters.
-# The atomisp driver starts the CSS API and then waits for interrupts. This is
 done for each frame.
-# The CSS API configures the CSS hardware and firmware by writing into
 registers and the SP data memory respectively.
-# The CSS API starts the SP by writing the start and run bits into its
 status & control register.
-# The SP firmware configures the rest of the CSS hardware and uses the DMA
 to download the ISP executable. Then it configures the ISP firmware by writing
 into the ISP data memory and starts the ISP processor.
-# While the ISP executes the firmware, the SP is used as a DMA proxy. The main
 reason for this is to save on the number of program instructions needed by the
 ISP firmware. The ISP has a local program memory of only 2048 instructions
 which means we can only execute a limited amount of code from this program
 memory. Configuring the DMA takes quite a number of instructions; by executing
 these from the SP we save program memory on the ISP.
-# While executing, the ISP continuously requests input data from the input
 formatter, processes this and requests the DMA to write the output data to
 external memory.
-# When the ISP is done processing the frame, it sends a stop token to the SP
 firmware. The SP then exits from its main function which brings the SP into
 the idle state. When this state transition occurs, the SP generates an
 interrupt which is handled on the host CPU.
-# The interrupt handler on the host CPU asks the CSS API what to do next. For
 certain modes, we need to execute multiple ISP executables in a row. When this
 is the case, the CSS API will tell the interrupt handler to start the next
 stage. This next stage is executed in the same way as the first one, just with
 a different ISP executable.
-# When the CSS API tells the interrupt handler that the frame is done (after
 all stages have been executed), the atomisp driver can send the output frame
 back to the application.
\subsection css_sw_data_sec Data Flow
The data flow depends on the mode of operation. In general though, we can say
 that the sensor output stream is stripped from all CSI markers and only the
 pixel data is sent to the input formatter(s). The input formatter converts the
 incoming stream into vectors (ISP SIMD words) and writes these vectors into the
 ISP vector memory.
The ISP receives a signal (token) from the input formatter and reads the new
 input data from its local vector memory into registers. The content of these
 registers is subsequently modified by instructions in the ISP data path. At
 the end of the processing cycle, the processed pixels are written to a second
 buffer in the same local vector memory. The DMA is then instructed to send this
 output data into external memory (into a buffer allocated on the host CPU).
In certain cases, this output data is then loaded from external memory by the
 application where it is displayed, encoded, processed or written to file.
In other cases, this data is further processed by other ISP executables. ISP
 executables that read input data from memory rather than from the CSI receiver
 are referred to as offline executables (or offline binaries).
\subsection css_sw_preview_sec Preview Mode
When running the ISP in preview mode, we execute 2 stages for each frame.
-# Preview stage: this does all line based image processing and writes the
 output frame to external memory. The input is acquired from the input
 formatter(s).
-# Vf_pp stage: this stage performs downscaling, digital zoom and format
 conversions. Since these are block based operations, implemented
 on the GDC block, we cannot combine it with the online line based image
 processing.
\section css_video_sec Video Mode
The video mode also consists of 2 stages:
-# Video stage. Similar to the preview stage in the preview mode, this stage
 performs line based image processing (including bayer downscaling when
 enabled). During this stage, the previous frame is read as a reference frame
 for temporal noise reduction. The input data is acquired from the input
 formatter(s) and the output frame is written to external memory. Since the
 reference frame must be created before digital zoom, this stage writes out
 2 frames, one is the output frame (possibly zoomed) and the other is the
 reference frame for the next run.
-# Vf_pp stage: this performs the same tasks as the vf_pp stage in the preview
 mode.
\section css_stillcap_sec Still Capture Mode
Here we distinguish 3 types.
\subsection css_stillcap_raw_sec RAW Capture
This mode captures RAW data from the sensor output to external memory. The only
 processing done here is re-ordering of pixels (for example to convert from
 yuv420 input data to nv12 output data). We only execute one stage in this mode
 which performs all processing necessary. Input is read from the input
 formatter(s) and output is written to external memory. This mode also produces
 a viewfinder output frame.
\subsection css_stillcap_primary_sec Primary Capture
In primary capture mode, we execute 2 or 3 stages, depending on which
 functionality is enabled:
-# Primary stage: this runs all line based image processing on input from either
 memory or the input formatter(s). This can be determined at runtime and is used
 to provide RAW+JPEG functionality where we capture both the RAW bayer
 frame and a processed YUV frame which is subsequently encoded to JPEG.
-# Capture_pp stage: this stage performs post-processing on the capture frame.
 This includes XNR, digital zoom and YUV downscaling. This stage is only
 executed when one or more of these features are enabled.
-# Vf_pp stage: this performs the same tasks as the vf_pp in preview and video
 mode.
\subsection css_stillcap_advanced_sec Advanced Capture
The advanced capture mode adds GDCAC capabilities. This is a block based
 algorithm which means we need additional stages.
-# Copy stage: this captures the RAW input data from the input formatter(s) into
 external memory.
-# Pre-GDC stage: this implements all line based image processing that needs to
 be done before the GDCAC stage.
-# GDC stage: this stage executes the GDCAC functionality on the
 GDC accelerator. It reads input data from external memory and writes output
 data back to external memory.
-# Post-GDC stage: this contains all line-based image processing that needs to
 be done after the GDCAC stage.
-# Capture_pp stage: this stage performs post-processing on the capture frame.
 This includes XNR, digital zoom and YUV downscaling. This stage is only
 executed when one or more of these features are enabled.
-# Vf_pp stage: this performs the same tasks as the vf_pp in preview and video
 mode.

/*! \page css_intro API Introduction
\section css_intro_overview_sec Overview
The CSS API contains functions to control all software running on the CSS
 hardware. This software implements all features commonly found in a digital
 camera: preview, still capture and video capture.
This document is organized as follows:
- Common Data Types and Functions
- Preview
- Still Capture
- Video Capture
- ISP Parameters
- Example Applications
- API Reference

\section css_intro_versioning_sec Versioning
The API version is also embedded in the API header file. It is advised that
 applications check against this version such that version changes are
 automatically detected. Especially since the API is still in beta phase,
 differences between versions can be significant. It is also advised to check
 the version of this document against the actual API version in the header file,
 both should match.
\section css_intro_conventions_sec Notational Conventions
This document contains numerous code snippets and examples, all of these are
 printed like this:
\code
enum sh_css_err sh_css_preview_start(struct sh_css_frame *output_frame);
\endcode
When showing declarations that are part of the API, the declared symbol (type or
 function) will be printed in bold (as shown here for the function
 ::sh_css_preview_start).
\section css_intro_reference_sec API Reference
Each section will explain the use of several types and/or functions, the
 reference documentation for these is included at the end of each section. For
 each function, the prototype is shown, followed by the explanation of the
 function and a list of arguments and the return value. When the argument list
 or the return value is empty, it will be omitted.
\section css_intro_integration_sec Software Integration
The CSS API and its implementation do not depend on any particular environment
 or Operating System (OS). It does not use any features from external libraries
 such as libc, this means it can run in any OS and in kernel or user space mode.
 It is expected however that this API will normally be part of a kernel level
 driver.

 Controls when the Event generator in the CSS raises an IRQ to the Host.

 between the CSS and the Host. This will help saving power as it wakes up the
 Host less often. In case both or_mask and and_mask are
 SH_CSS_EVENT_IRQ_MASK_NONE for all pipes, no event IRQ's will be raised.
 Note that events are still queued and the Host can poll for them. The
 or_mask and and_mask may be be active at the same time\n

 Default values, for all pipe id's, after sh_css_init:\n
 or_mask = SH_CSS_EVENT_IRQ_MASK_ALL\n
 and_mask = SH_CSS_EVENT_IRQ_MASK_NONE\n
 \n
 Precondition:\n
 sh_css_init_buffer_queues() must be executed first\n

 SH_CSS_EVENT_IRQ_MASK_NONE);
 \endcode
 The event generator will only raise an interrupt to the Host when there are
 3A or DIS statistics available from the preview pipe. It will not generate
 an interrupt for any other event of the preview pipe e.g when there is an
 output frame available.

 \code
 sh_css_event_set_irq_mask(SH_CSS_PREVIEW_PIPELINE,

 \endcode
 The event generator will only raise an interrupt to the Host when there is
 both a frame done and 3A event available from the preview pipe AND when there
 is a frame done available from the capture pipe. Note that these events
 may occur at different moments in time. Also the order of the events is not
 relevant.
