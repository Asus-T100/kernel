/*!
 * \brief
 * Define the public interface for virtual memory
 * access functions. Access types are limited to
 * those defined in <stdint.h>
 *
 * The address representation is private to the system
 * and represented as "hrt_vaddress" rather than a
 * pointer, as the memory allocation cannot be accessed
 * by dereferencing but reaquires load and store access
 * functions
 *
 * The page table selection or virtual memory context;
 * The page table base index; Is implicit. This page
 * table base index must be set by the implementation
 * of the access function
 *
 * "store" is a transfer to the system
 * "load" is a transfer from the system
 *
 * Allocation properties can be specified by setting
 * attributes (see below) in case of multiple physical
 * memories the memory ID is encoded on the attribute
 *
 * Allocations in the same physical memory, but in a
 * different (set of) page tables can be shared through
 * a page table information mapping function

/*!
 * \brief
 * Bit masks for specialised allocation functions
 * the default is "uncached", "not contiguous",
 * "not page aligned" and "not cleared"
 *
 * Forcing alignment (usually) returns a pointer
 * at an alignment boundary that is offset from
 * the allocated pointer. Without storing this
 * pointer/offset, we cannot free it. The memory
 * manager is responsible for the bookkeeping, e.g.
 * the allocation function creates a sentinel
 * within the allocation referencable from the
 * returned pointer/address.
