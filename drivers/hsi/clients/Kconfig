config HSI_CHAR
	tristate "HSI/SSI character driver"
	depends on HSI
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will enable the HSI/SSI character driver.
	  This driver provides a simple character device interface for
	  serial communication with the cellular modem over HSI/SSI bus.

config HSI_FFL_TTY
	tristate "Fixed frame length protocol on HSI"
	default n
	depends on HSI
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will enable the fixed frame length protocol
	  driver over an HSI physical link.
	  This driver implements a TTY interface for transferring data over
	  HSI between two devices using a fixed frame length protocol.

	  If unsure, say N.

if HSI_FFL_TTY

config HSI_FFL_TTY_NAME
	string "Base name for the TTY"
	default "IFX"
	help
	  Sets the base name for the TTY associated to this fixed frame length
	  protocol.
	  The base name will be appended to the tty interface used by the HSI
	  fixed frame length protocol.

	  If unsure, use the default value.


config HSI_FFL_TTY_FRAME_LENGTH
	int "Fixed frame length"
	default "4096"
	range 4 131072
	help
	  Sets the fixed frame length in bytes to be used in this protocol
	  driver. This frame length must be a multiple of 4 bytes, set between
	  4 bytes and 128 kiB (131072 bytes).

	  Set to 4096 bytes by default.

config HSI_FFL_TTY_HEADER_LENGTH
	int "Fixed frame header length"
	default "4"
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets the fixed frame header length in bytes to be used in this
	  protocol driver. This header length must be set to 4 in normal usage
	  or to 0 in raw protocol debug mode.

	  Set to 4 bytes by default.

config HSI_FFL_ENSURE_LAST_WORD_NULL
	bool "Ensuring that all TX FFL frames end with zeros"
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, the FFL maximal payload will be reduced by 4 bytes
	  to ensure that the last HSI word is filled with zeros. This feature
	  is ensuring that both the CADATA and CAFLAG signals are low at the
	  end of a FFL frame so that no simultaneous DATA and FLAG transitions
	  can be spotted when the IP is being power-cut.

	  If the attached modem is robust with respect to simultanous DATA and
	  FLAG transition, say N. Otherwise, it is always safer to say Y.


config HSI_FFL_TTY_CHANNEL
	int "HSI channel"
	default "0"
	range 0 15
	help
	  Sets the default single channel index to be used for the FFL protocol.
	  You may need to change this value depending of the implementation of the
	  fixed length frame (FFL) protocol.
	  Set to 0 by default.
	  If unsure, use the default value.


config HSI_FFL_TTY_STATS
	bool "Statistics to assess the performance of the protocol"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will instanciate performance related counters
	  for measuring the number of sent and received frames as well as their
	  total actual length in bytes.

	  If not fine-tuning the HSI FFL driver, say N.

config HSI_DLP
	tristate "Data Link Protocol protocol on HSI for LTE IMC modems"
	default n
	depends on HSI
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will enable the DLP protocol for LTE IMC modem
	  over an HSI physical link.
	  This driver implements network interfaces and a TTY interface for
	  transferring data over HSI between an APE and an IMC modem.

	  If unsure, say N.

if HSI_DLP

config HSI_DLP_IPC_TTY_NAME
	string "Base name for the IPC TTY"
	default "IFX"
	help
	  Sets the base name for the TTY associated to this IMC modem protocol
	  for LTE.
	  The base name will be appended to the tty interface used by the HSI
	  eDLP protocol.

	  If unsure, use the default value.

config HSI_FLASHING_DEV_NAME
	string "Base name for the Boot/Flashing driver"
	default "IFX"
	help
	  Sets the base name for the char device associated to this IMC
	  Boot/Flashing protocol. The base name will be appended to the char
	  device interface used by the HSI flashing protocol

	  If unsure, use the default value.

config HSI_TRACE_DEV_NAME
	string "The name for the Modem trace driver"
	default "mdmTrace"
	help
	  Sets the name for the char device associated to this IMC trace protocol

	  If unsure, use the default value.

config HSI_DLP_NET_NAME
	string "Base name for the network interfaces"
	default "rmnet"
	help
	  The base name will be exported by the network interface used by the
	  HSI eDLP protocol

	  If unsure, use the default value.

config HSI_DLP_PDU_LENGTH
	int "Fixed frame length"
	default "4096"
	range 4 131072
	help
	  Sets the fixed frame length in bytes to be used in this protocol
	  driver. This frame length must be a multiple of 4 bytes, set between
	  4 bytes and 128 kiB (131072 bytes).

	  Set to 4096 bytes by default.

config HSI_DLP_TTY_STATS
	bool "Statistics to assess the performance of the protocol (TTY)"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will instanciate performance related counters
	  for measuring the number of sent and received frames as well as their
	  total actual length in bytes.

	  If not fine-tuning the HSI IMC LTE driver, say N.

config HSI_DLP_HEADER_LENGTH
	int "Fixed frame header length"
	default "4"
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets the fixed frame header length in bytes to be used in this
	  protocol driver. This header length must be set to 4 in normal usage
	  or to 0 in raw protocol debug mode.

config HSI_LOGICAL

	  If you say Y here, you will enable the DLP protocol for RMC modem
	  over an HSI physical link.

	  If unsure, say N.

	depends on HSI_LOGICAL
	default "3"
	help
	  Specifies the HSI version used to communicate with the RMC
	  modem. Version 3 supports 3bits of channel and the Management
	  of HSI_POWER_OFF message.
