# Generic thermal sysfs drivers configuration

menuconfig THERMAL
	tristate "Generic Thermal sysfs driver"
	help
	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

config THERMAL_HWMON
	bool "Hardware monitoring support"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on HWMON=y || HWMON=THERMAL
	help
	  The generic thermal sysfs driver's hardware monitoring support
	  requires a 2.10.7/3.0.2 or later lm-sensors userspace.

	  Say Y if your user-space is new enough.

config THERMAL_DEBUG
	bool "Thermal debug information support"
	depends on THERMAL
	help
	  This enables debug sysfs interfaces/information for Thermal
	  subsystem.

	  Saying Y here will expose extra sysfs nodes under
	  /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zoneX/

config SENSORS_THERMAL_MRFLD
        tristate "Thermal driver for Intel Merrifield platform"
        depends on THERMAL && INTEL_SCU_IPC && BASINCOVE_GPADC
        help
          Say Y here to enable thermal driver on Intel Merrifield
          platform.

          To load this driver as a module, select M here. The module
          will be called "mrfl_thermal"

config SOC_THERMAL
	tristate "SoC Thermal driver"
	depends on THERMAL
	help
	  SoC Thermal driver registers to Generic Thermal Framework.
	  Exposes SoC DTS and aux trip point values through the framework.

          Say Y here to enable thermal driver on Intel Merrifield
          platform. To load this driver as a module, select M here.
